# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Analysis
Introduction:
In this project, utilize the provided eCommerce dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data to implement a Customer Segmentation model using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. RFM segmentation enables grouping customers based on recent purchasing behavior, frequency, and monetary value, facilitating targeted marketing and customer engagement strategies.

Objective:
Perform RFM analysis on the dataset to segment customers into distinct groups based on their RFM scores. These segments will provide valuable insights for marketing and customer retention strategies.

Tasks:
1. Data Preprocessing:
Import the dataset and conduct necessary preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and data type conversion.
2. RFM Calculation:
Calculate RFM metrics for each customer:
Recency (R): Days since the customer's last purchase.
Frequency (F): Total number of orders for each customer.
Monetary (M): Sum of the total purchase value for each customer.
3. RFM Segmentation:
Assign RFM scores based on quartiles or custom-defined bins for each metric.
Combine RFM scores to create a single score for each customer.
4. Customer Segmentation:
Utilize clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers based on RFM scores.
Experiment with different cluster numbers to find the optimal segmentation.
5. Segment Profiling:
Analyze and profile each customer segment, describing characteristics, RFM scores, and relevant attributes.
6. Marketing Recommendations:
Provide actionable marketing recommendations for each segment to improve customer retention and maximize revenue.
7. Visualization:
Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots) illustrating RFM distribution and formed clusters.
